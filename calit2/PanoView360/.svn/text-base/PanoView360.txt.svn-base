The covise plugin expects the images to be in RGB format with 8bits
per channel and the dimensions to be multiples of 4K.  You can use
whatever image editor you want to do this.  Traditionally, for lack of
a good alternative, I have been using convert from the image magick
library.  An example image resize would be:
convert source.tif -depth 8 -resize 16384x8192! dest.tif

If you go much bigger than that, you will likely run into memory limits on load.

After that, an entry needs to be added for the image set in
PanoView360 Files tag of the covise config file.
The options in this entry are:
reye - right eye image
leye - left eye image
radius - world space radius of sphere/cylinder
viewanglev - vertical view angle
viewangleh - horizontal view angle
camHeight - height offset for camera position
segments - number of segments to use when rendering
tsize - image tile size
sphere - render as sphere instead of cylinder
