CalVR 127.0.0.1.vnc

Note:

Need to modify VncClient.cpp under OpenSceneGraph

//pictureQuad->setEventCallback(new osgViewer::InteractiveImageHandler(_vncImage.get()));
pictureQuad->setCullCallback(new osgViewer::InteractiveImageHandler(_vncImage.get())); // needed to trigger updates

To execute remote brower queries you need to set up firefox with mozlrep plugin and enable it, and add entries in the OsgVnc config 
which will direct those queries to that browser.

Plugin.OsgVnc.BrowserQueryServer = remote machine with brower running
Plugin.OsgVnc.Port = port mozlrep is configured for (if not specified 4242 is used)
