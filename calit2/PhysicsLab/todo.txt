- keep balls from falling asleep/unresponsive
- more balls?
- different texture on trampoline; find trampoline model
- more details on texture of play box
- measure time it takes to win, show leaderboard
- when someone hits the ring for the first time, take a configuration
  screenshot to look at later
- target needs to be a unique 3D model - remove 2nd (vertical) ring. maybe
  model something more like a basket. Have player collect all balls in the
  basket instead of just one.
